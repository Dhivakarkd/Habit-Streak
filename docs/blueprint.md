## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light grey (#F4F2F9), a very desaturated near-tone of the primary color, provides a subtle contrast and makes the interface easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Blue (#59A0F0), an analogous color, draws attention to key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font that offers a modern, neutral aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear and simple icons for daily check-in status and challenge types.
- Clean and straightforward layout with a focus on the streak counter. Emphasize visual feedback for check-ins.
- Subtle animations for check-in confirmations and streak updates to provide positive reinforcement.
